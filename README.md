*Recommend clothes for today's weather*

Skycloset is the closest md to making your day pleasant. At the beginning of the day, it gives brief weather information and recommends clothes with the appropriate thickness for today's wear. You can check this by time zone. Also, at the end of the day, this app receives the satisfaction of the day and grows every day to suit you better.

**[Install on Google Play (Beta Testing)](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.plaidapp)**

##### Non-Goals
Skycloset is a small project for Demoday of CEOS, so it has limited manpower and time. In order to fully implement the features required to run the app under these conditions, it explicitly does not attempt to:
* Supports **IOS** environments; it utilizes vanilla Android components. For advice on this, I'd recommend [Blueprints](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture).
* Support **pre-JellyBean** devices. React Native apps target iOS 9.0 and Android 4.1 (API 16) or newer.
